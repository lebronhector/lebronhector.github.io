					<h3> "i wish" </h3>	
					<p>	br promised you the world just to get in your pants.<br>
					i promissed you the world <br> and instead gave you my heart.<br>
					He told you that he loved you <br>but it didn't feel the same. <br> <br> i think how much i love you <br> and i just feel pain. <br> <br>you are with him because of how you feel <br>knowing he doesn't feel the same. everytime i go to sleep in the middle of the night i wake calling out your name. danm how i wish you felt thesame.</p>

					<p>	if i were on the highest cliff,<br>
					  	on the highest rift <br>
					  	and you slipped off the side<br> 
					  	and clenched on to your life <br>
					  	in my grip.<br>

					  	i will never, <br>
					  	<span>ever!</span> <br>
					  	let you <br>
					  	down! <br> <br>

					  	see i too dream in color and in rhyme.
					  	<br> so i guess i am one of a kind<br>
					  	in a full house.
					  	<br><br>

					  	my soul <br>
					  	or my mouth!<br>

					so many styles that make <br>that story called,

					we look at animals,we judge, <br>we kill, act and<br>
					react.we
					stuff, mount,<br> use for sport or to parade around town.<br>
